This is my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges, based on Apple's [Advent of Code Swift Starter Project](https://github.com/apple/swift-aoc-starter-example)


### Usage

Place your input files in `Sources/Data` with the name `DayXX.txt` where `XX` is the day of the challenge.

Run a specific day with `swift run -c release AdventOfCode XX` where `XX` is the day of the challenge.

Alternatively, benchmark a specific day with `swift run -c release AdventOfCode --benchmark XX` where `XX` is the day of the challenge.
